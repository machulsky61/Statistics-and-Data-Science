# Human Body Morphology Analysis

---

## Project Description

This project is part of the final exam at Statistics course and showcases the skills learned through the subject. I used advanced statistical analysis techniques to investigate the relationship between weight and various morphological variables based on human body morphology data.

## Project Content

### Objectives

- Analyze the relationship between weight and morphological variables.
- Utilize non-parametric regression techniques and regularization methods in linear models.

### Project Stages

1. **Data Reading**
   - Data loading from the `body.xls` file.
   - Verification and control of data integrity.

2. **Exploratory Stage**
   - Estimation of weight median by gender and calculation of confidence intervals using bootstrap.
   - Exploratory analysis of the relationship between height and weight, discriminating by gender.
   - Adjustment of non-parametric regressions and search for the optimal bandwidth.

3. **Linear Regression**
   - Fitting linear models using all explanatory variables.
   - Selection of significant covariates without multicollinearity.
   - Application of LASSO regularization method.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluation of empirical prediction error in the test group.
   - Final conclusions and recommendations.
